/*
 *  Credit: The majority of this code comes programming tutorials by a Youtuber named RealTutsGML
 * 			& the run, render, & tick methods are from Notch (the creator of Minecraft). The map
 * 			design was made by me & inspired by one of my child hood games.

 * 
 *  The Letter: The majority of my inspiration came from 2 games.The top-down gameplay is inspired by Hotline Miami while
 *  			the map design was inspired by Call of Duty Black Ops. Honestly, i encountered roadblocks all throughout the 
 *  			project because of the fact that I'm trying to teach myself a difficult subject at 1 in the morning all on my
 *  			own because i have no partner. In the end, I did learn a lot on how to developed a small game in java. What I
 *  			think makes my game unique is that i combined 2 separate game ideas into 1. Part of my code came from Notch who
 *  			is the creator of a game called Minecraft. His code gives me 60fps & it also updates my game a couple thousand
 *  			times per second. The majority of my code came from a youtube tutorial by a youtuber named RealTutsGML & he
 *  			taught me many things on making a game. For example, being able to use the keys or the mouse to activate events
 *  			& how to create a window in order to play the game. I even got the chance to create AI that follows you around the map.
 *     			Sadly, I was on my own in the end but I still gave it my best to finish up as much as I can. My final thoughts 
 *     			are that graphics for java should be taught to studentsbecause that's what they need in order to create fun little games.
